# The Right Tool for the Right Job

I help businesses move faster by building custom software—without the overhead. Whether it’s a polished UI, a smarter internal tool, or a workflow powered by Airtable, I deliver clean, reliable solutions—one task at a time.

## What I Do

You’re not just hiring a developer—you’re hiring outcomes.

With a decade of experience building production-grade software, I blend code and no-code tools to solve real business problems quickly and sustainably.

**Specialties:**

- **Custom UIs** with React.js & Next.js
- **Internal tools** built in Retool
- **Business apps** powered by Airtable

Every project is scoped to deliver what you need—and nothing you don’t.

## Who I Work With

🌱 **Local Businesses** — A simple site or workflow can go a long way

🏢 **Enterprises** — Upgrade your internal tools without the dev team overhead

This model is built for founders, ops leads, and non-technical decision-makers who need results without complexity.

## How I Work

I run this business solo, by design. That keeps things focused and high-quality—for both of us.

**My philosophy:**

- Simplicity over complexity
- Low-code when possible, custom code when needed
- Fast, async, and respectful of your time

From the Trello-based workflow to the subscription model, everything is built for sustainability and momentum.
