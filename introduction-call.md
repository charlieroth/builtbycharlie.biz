# Introduction Call

The introduction call is short, focused, and optional, Itâ€™s your chance to see if my monthly subscription model is the right fit for your businessâ€”no sales pitch, no fluff.

## What Weâ€™ll Cover

**Your Goals**

What are you working on? Where are things getting stuck? Weâ€™ll talk through you current workflows and where software could help.

**How I Work**

Iâ€™ll walk through the subscription model, how requests are handled in Trello, and what kind of results to expectâ€”so you know exactly how it works before you commit.

**Whether itâ€™s a fit**

Not every project needs custom software. If I think youâ€™re better off with a simpler path, Iâ€™ll tell you. If thereâ€™s a clear opportunity to help, Iâ€™ll explain where weâ€™d start.

**Format:**

- 15 minutes, on the dot
- No commitment required
- No pressure to subscribe
