# About

I started *Built by Charlie* for freedom—freedom to choose meaningful work, learn new tools, and turn those tools into real opportunities.

As a solo contractor, every skill I pick up becomes a way to help clients and grow my business. That’s the kind of alignment I was missing—and the kind I now build into every engagement.

## How I Work

No fluff. No over-engineering. Just clear, functional software that moves the needle.

I keep things simple, fast, and effective:

- Use the simplest tech that solves the problem
- Lean on low-code (Retool, Airtable) where it makes sense
- Reach for custom code (React.js, Next.js) when you need precision or polish
- Prioritize business outcomes over technical complexity

This isn't about tech for tech’s sake. It’s about clarity, speed, and impact.

## Built for Sustainability

I run this business solo—and that’s by design. It keeps the quality high, the workflow clean, and the energy focused.

- I limit active clients to avoid burnout
- I mark myself unavailable when at capacity
- I use downtime to refine systems, publish content, and sharpen the offering

From Trello workflows to the monthly subscription, everything here is built for long-term momentum—for both of us.

## What I Believe

You’re not hiring code. You’re hiring results.

Let’s cut the waste and build smarter—one well-scoped task at a time.
