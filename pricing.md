Need to take a break? Pause your subscription anytime after the first week. Your remaining days roll over—you pick up right where you left off.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Subscribe** and get your dedicated Trello board
2. **Add requests**—I’ll handle one at a time.
3. **Review and approve** each result
