# Services

You're not here for code. You're here for clarity, speed, and results.

That’s where I come in.

With over 7 years of hands on software engineering experience, building everything from elegant frontend UIs to robust internal systems, I now help businesses like yours move faster by combining code and no-code tools in smart, efficient ways.

Whether you're buried in spreadsheets, bogged down by manual tasks, or stuck waiting on dev cycles—I help you build the right level of software to move forward with confidence.

## What I Build (and How)

### 🧱 Airtable - Structure Without the Overhead

If your team lives in spreadsheets, Airtable is your upgrade path. I use it to create lightweight CRMs, project trackers, and workflow tools that are easy to use and even easier to maintain.

- Get organized fast with no-code simplicity
- Automate repetitive tasks using AI features
- Share access and keep your team aligned

Airtable is the perfect foundation for businesses just starting to digitize their operations or looking for a quick win without a heavy tech investment.

### ⚡️ Retool - Internal Tools, Built in Days

When your data is ready but your internal tooling isn’t, Retool is the answer. I use it to build admin panels, dashboards, and automations that connect directly to your databases, APIs, CRMs, and SaaS platforms.

- Rapid development of real software, not clunky workarounds
- Secure, role-based access and SSO support
- Native support for ETL workflows and AI-driven actions

It’s developer-grade power without the traditional dev time.

### 🧑‍💻 Custom UIs - Polished, Branded, Public-Facing

Need something more tailored or customer-facing? I build modern, performant web apps and marketing pages with React.js and Next.js—no fluff, no over-engineering.

- Responsive and lightning-fast
- Designed to scale and integrate with your backend
- Hosted on platforms like Vercel for maximum reliability
- Rapid, AI-assisted prototyping using tools like [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/)

## Hybrid Approach: Code Meets No-Code

Because I work across the spectrum—from Airtable to Retool to full custom UIs—I can meet your business where it’s at and grow with you:

1. **Start** with Airtable to organize your operations
2. **Scale** with Retool to build internal tools around your systems
3. **Polish** with custom code when branding, complexity, or performance matters

You get the right level of tech at the right time—without hiring a team or reinventing the wheel.

- I work async, fast, and focused so you’re never waiting on me
